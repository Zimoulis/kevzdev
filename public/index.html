                                Hi, and welcome to my site. My name is Kevin and I am a software developer and  
                                I have a passion for learning and creating new things. Ever since I was young I enjoyed
                                finding out how things work under the hood and using that knowledge to  be creative and build interesting things.
                                Ultimately, once i took my first programming course I became excited for all the potential things 
                                that I could create. Since then I have just been honing in on my skills as a developer and always
                                trying to improve and devlop

                                <br><br>My background has been 
                                primarily in the backend working with stacks like Java, Spring, Hibernate, and 
                                various relational databases at my job. However, outside of work I have been falling
                                in love with some of the web development stacks such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Nodejs. 
                                It has been a blast working with them with so many neat things to learn. 
                                <br><br>Throughout this site 
                                I hope showcase some of projects and write about some new some of the things that interest me. 
                                In time I hope to have allot of projects and content that you may find interesting or useful.
                                So welcome, and come on in see what i am all about. I hope that you will 
                                find something here that is interesting in for you.

Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.
